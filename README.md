# NORVI-EX-BR01
an expansion module with 2 Channel Load Cell Interface.

NORVI is always about connectivity and expandability. This is the time to make use of the Expansion port of NORVI Controllers. The series of expansion modules connect to NORVI IoT controllers via its I2C and UART connections. You can add more features to the NORVI Controller without huge customizations. NORVI provides true technology with reliability for industrial applications being the world's IoT hardware manufacturer.

NORVI-EX-BR01 uses SC18IS602 over I2C communication. On devices with address configuration support. The I2C
addresses of the devices can be configured with the DIP switches at the bottom of the controller. It can Daisy chain
up to 6 expansion modules.

2 channel load cell interface with HX711 24 bit ADC. I2C  Interface with controller.
